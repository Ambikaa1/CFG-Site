  </h2>

  <h3> <p>
  Bristol is a city full of culture, excitement and enjoyable days out within walking distance and for affordable prices. Whether you are here for just a day or you live in Bristol, these sights and activities are a sure way to get to know Bristol better by taking advantage of its culture and rich history.
</p>
<p>
  	- Bristol  Cathedral - this gothic revival cathedral was founded in 1140 and consecrated in 1148, originally as St. Augustines Abbey but was affected by the dissolution of the monasteries that happened under HVIII's reign in 1540. Located on college green, the cathedral is in a picturesque and central spot, perfect for strolling around and features numerous interesting architectural features.
</p>
<p>
  	- Clifton Suspension Bridge - the bridge is, of course, a popular spot for both tourists and locals thanks to its remarkable views of Bristol and the Avon Gorge. It may be a clich√© but when in Bristol, it is something you just cannot miss. The bridge was  built in 1831 after being designed by Isambard Brunel and was finally completed in 1864 after his death. Around this area, there are also an array of places to eat and grab coffee in Clifton which is also a sweet place to visit.
</p>
<p>
  	- Bristol Museum - This museum, located next to the Wills Memorial Building on Park Street boasts not only free entry but also insight into archaeology, geology and art. This includes fossils, art by Banksy and a Romany caravan. The museum also hosts family events and workshops so it is a perfect visit even with children.
</p>
<p>
  	- Banksy Walking Tour - Bristol is famous for its street art which is understandable considering just how jam packed it is. A self-guided walking tour around the best pieces including that of Banksy is a fun way to see the city and gain a sense of its culture. One example of this is his Girl with the Pierced Eardrum.
</p>
<p>
  	- M Shed - In order to gain insight into not just art and history in general but art and history that is specific to Bristol, M shed is an obvious choice. Located in the Harbour side area, this museum is perfect to visit in the evening due to its close proximity to some of the city's most popular dining and drinking spots.
